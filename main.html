    <section id="history">
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The Safia pastry chain is a family business whose story begins with an amateur pastry chef, Mukhayo Ayupova. Her hard work and love of home baking prompted her in 2001 to go beyond the family kitchen and start baking for sale, first for relatives, friends and neighbors. Her husband, Akmal Ayupov, supports Mukhayo's creative endeavor and organizes the delivery of the finished products.</p>
